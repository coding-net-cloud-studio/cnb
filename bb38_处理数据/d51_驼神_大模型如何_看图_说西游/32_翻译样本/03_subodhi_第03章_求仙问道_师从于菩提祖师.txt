Monkey sailed over the ocean for a long time.

石猴在海上漂流了很久很久.

Finally, he arrived at a new land.

终于,他来到了一片新大陆.

He walked for many years, visiting towns and meeting people.

上岸后,他又走访多年,巡查了很多城镇,遇见了很多人.

But he didn't find a sage anywhere. Eventually(最终) he came to mountains covered in thick(厚的) forest.

但是他始终没有找到一位仙人.最后,他走进了一座森林茂密的大山.

He headed up a steep(陡峭的,险峻的) mountain trail(小径,小路) and soon heard chopping(砍,劈).

他沿着山中的一条陡峭的小路攀缘而上,不一会儿就听到了砍柴声.

A woodcutter(伐木者,樵夫) was chopping firewood(木柴,柴火).

一位樵夫正在砍柴.

"Hello."said Monkey.

"你好呀."石猴说.

"Are there any sages in these mountains?"

"这山里有神仙吗?"

The woodcutter dropped his ax.

樵夫大吃一惊,扔掉了手中的斧头.

"You're… amonkey!" he said.

"你是……一只猴子!"他说.

"And you're talking!"

"而且,你还会说话!"

"Yes, I am." said Monkey.

"是呢,没错."石猴说.

"And I want to live forever. Do you know where I can find a sage?"

"而且我还想要长生不老呢,你知道哪里能找到神仙吗?"

The woodcutter scratched his head. "Well, yes," he said.

樵夫挠了挠头."嗯,知道,"他说.

"A sage named Subodhi lives on this mountain. He is very wise(聪明的,明智的)."

"有位叫菩提祖师的仙人住在这山里,他是位智者."

Monkey was excited. "Where can I find him?"

石猴很激动."我去哪能找到他呢?"

"Just follow this trail(小径,小路), and you will come to his home," said the woodcutter.

"沿着这条小路走,你就能找到他了,"樵夫说.

"Thank you!"said Monkey.

"谢谢你!"石猴说.

He waved good-bye to the woodcutter and ran up the trail.

他和樵夫挥手告别,沿着小路一路小跑走了.

Soon he saw a temple(神殿,庙宇,寺院) built into the side(旁边,侧面) of the mountain.

一眨眼的功夫,他就看到大山旁有座庙宇.

Subodhi was sitting with his students in the main room of his temple.

庙里,菩提祖师和他的徒弟们在正殿上打坐.

He looked at his oldest student.

他看着他的大徒弟.

"Please go to the door," said Subodhi. "A new student is about to arrive. Let him in."

"请去开门,"菩提祖师说,"一个新徒弟差不多到了,你去让他进来吧."

The studentlooked confused(混乱的,困惑的).

大徒弟看上去有些困惑.

"Okay, Master(大师,师傅)." he said.

"是,师父."他说.

The student got up and went to the door of the temple.

大徒弟起身,来到庙门前.

He looked outside.

他向外看了看.

"Hello!" called Monkey. "I'm here to see Subodhi!"

"你好呀!"石猴说."我是来这儿见菩提祖师的!"

A moment later Monkey was standing in front of the sage.

转眼,石猴就站在了仙人的面前.

"I want to be your student," said Monkey.

"我想拜您为师."石猴说.

"But you're just(仅仅,只是) a monkey." said Subodhi.

"可你,是一只猴子呀."菩提祖师说.

"How can you be my student?"

"你怎么做我徒弟呢?"

Monkey laughed."I might be a monkey. But I can walk and talk and do many other things."

石猴大笑."我的确看上去是只猴子.但是我能像人一样走路,说话,还能做好多其他的事儿呢."

"I traveled almost(几乎,差不多) 13 years to get here. I'm sure I can be your student."

"我走了将近13年才来到这里.我很确信我可以做你的徒弟."

Subodhi stared(凝视,盯着看) at Monkey for a moment.

菩提祖师盯着石猴半晌.

"Who are your parents(父母)?" he asked.

"你父母是谁?"他问.

Monkey scratched his head.

石猴挠了挠头.

"I don't have parents," he said.

"我没有父母,"他说.

"I was born(出生 bear-bore-born) from arock."

"我是从石头里蹦出来的."

"Interesting,"said Subodhi.

"有意思,"菩提祖师说.

"You were probably(大概,或许) created(创造,创作) by Heaven and Earth."

"你大概是天地所生."

"You may be my student. You need a name."

"你可以做我的徒弟,我得给你取个名字."

He thought for a moment.

他想了一会儿.

"I will call you Sun Wukong."

"你就叫孙悟空吧."

For the next seven years, Sun Wukong lived in Subodhi's temple.

在接下来的七年时间里,孙悟空就住在菩提祖师的庙里.

The monkey spent his days meditating(冥想,沉思), listening to his teacher's lessons, and doing chores(家庭杂务).

他每天打坐冥想,听师父讲道,干一些杂活.

One day, while Subodhi was giving a lesson, Wukong started to dance.

这天,菩提祖师正在讲道,悟空突然手舞足蹈起来.

Subodhi stood up. "How dare you dance while I'm teaching?" heshouted.

菩提祖师站起身来,"你竟敢在我讲道时跳舞?!"他训斥道.

"I'm sorry," said Wukong. "But I was so happy, I needed to dance!"

"对不起,"悟空说."我只是太高兴了才会跳舞!"

Subodhi calmed down(镇定下来). "You're happy?"

菩提祖师平静了下来."你很高兴?"

"Yes," said the Monkey. "I love learning from you."

"是呀."石猴说."我非常喜欢听您讲道."

"Wukong, you have been here a long time. What would you like tolearn from me?" asked Subodhi.

"悟空,你已经来了很长时间了.你想让我教你什么呢?"菩提祖师问.

Wukong shrugged. "I don't know. You tell me what I should learn."

悟空耸耸肩."我不知道呢.你告诉我应该学些啥?"

"Well,"said Subodhi, "I can teach you how to tell the future(未来).Would you like that?"

"嗯,"菩提祖师说,"我可以教你未卜先知.你想学这个吗?"

"Maybe,"said Wukong. "Will it make me live forever?"

"也行,"悟空说."学这个会让我长生不老吗?"

"Of course not," said Subodhi.

"当然不会,"菩提祖师说.

"Then forget(忘记) it." said Wukong. "Teach me something else."

"那就算了吧."悟空说."教我点别的吧."

"Hmm," said Subodhi. "How about some magic breathing(呼吸) exercises(运动)?"

"那,"菩提祖师说."教你吐纳呼吸?"

"Will they make me live forever?" asked Wukong.

"这能让我长生不老吗?"悟空问.

"No," said Subodhi, frowning.

"那倒不能,"菩提祖师说着便皱起了眉头.

"Then I'm not interested," said Wukong.

"那我就没兴趣学了,"悟空说.

Subodhi became angry.

菩提祖师生气了.

He stood up and knocked Wukong on the head three times.

他站起身来,对着悟空的脑袋敲了三下.

Then he left the room.

然后他就离开了.

"Wukong," said another student." You were very rude(粗鲁的,无礼的) to Master!"

"悟空,"一个徒弟说."你对师父真是太无礼了!"

The other students all agreed.

其他徒弟纷纷附和.

Wukong,however, smiled.

然而,只有悟空笑了起来.

None(一个也没,没有任何人或物) of the other students knew it, butSubodhi had given(给 give-gave-given) him a secret(秘密的) message(消息,口信).

他们都不知道,这其实是菩提祖师对他的暗示.
