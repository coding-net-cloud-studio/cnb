Have you not seen it? The waters of the Yellow River pour down from the heavens,
waves rolling relentlessly towards the East Sea, never to return.


Have you not seen it? In the hall, before the bright mirror, lamenting the white hair,
in the morning still a head full of black strands, by evening turned snowy white.


In the prime of life, one should indulge in joy; do not let the golden cup stand empty before the bright moon.

Heaven has created me for a purpose, there will surely be great use for me,
even if a thousand gold pieces are spent, they will be regained.

For now, let us feast on roasted sheep and oxen, and drink our fill,
even three hundred cups are not too many!


Sir Cen, Master Danqiu, drink up, do not stop the cups.


I will sing a song for you, please lend your ears and listen carefully.

The luxurious life of bell chimes and bronze food cauldrons is not truly valuable,
I wish to stay forever drunk, never to be sober again.


Since ancient times, saints and sages have been neglected and lonely,
only those who drink well can leave behind a beautiful name.


Prince Chen Cao Zhi once held a grand feast at the Pingle Garden,
where a jar of wine was worth a thousand gold pieces, yet he still laughed with joy.


Host, do not worry about spending too little money, just bring out the wine and let me drink with my friends.


Bring the noble five-flowered horse, take out the fox fur coat worth a thousand gold pieces,
quickly have the servants exchange them for fine wine, let us raise our cups together to dissolve this ancient sorrow.
