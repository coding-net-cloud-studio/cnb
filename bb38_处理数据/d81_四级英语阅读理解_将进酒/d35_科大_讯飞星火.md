"Have you not seen the waters of the Yellow River come tumbling from the sky, rolling ceaselessly towards the Eastern Sea, never to return?

Have you not seen the mirror in the high hall, lamenting the white hair, once so black in the morning, now as snow at night?

Life is full of joy, let us sing and dance without restraint, do not let the golden cup face the bright moon alone.

Nature has made me a pillar of society, I will surely be put to great use, even if I spend all my gold, I will earn it back.

Killing sheep and cattle, let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest, even three hundred cups in one go is not too much!

Cen Fuzi and Dan Qiu Sheng, please drink quickly, don't stop your cup.

I will sing a song for you, please listen closely.

The luxury of bells and tripods is not precious, I wish to be forever drunk, never to wake up.

Since ancient times, the saints and sages have been lonely and neglected, only those who drink well leave a good name.

Chen Wang Cao Zhi once held a grand feast at Ping Le Guan, still laughing heartily even though a pint of wine was worth a thousand gold.

Don't worry about giving less money, just bring out the wine and let me accompany my friends.

Bring out the famous five-colored horse, take out the fur coat worth a thousand gold, quickly call the servant to exchange it for fine wine, let us raise our glasses together and dissolve this eternal sorrow."
