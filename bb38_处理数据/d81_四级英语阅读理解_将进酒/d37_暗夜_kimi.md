Can you not see, the Yellow River's water pours down from the heavens,
its waves rolling straight to the East Sea and never returning.

Can you not see, in the high hall facing the bright mirror, lamenting the white hair,
still a head full of black tresses in the morning, by evening turned as white as snow.

When life is in favor, one should indulge in joy,
never let the golden cup face the bright moon empty.

Heaven has made me a pillar of talent, destined for great use;
even if a thousand taels of gold are spent, they will be regained.

Slaughtering sheep and butchering oxen, let us indulge in joy,
one drink of three hundred cups is not too much!

Mr. Cen, Danqiu Sheng, please drink quickly, do not stop the cup.

I will sing a song for you, please lend me your ears and listen carefully.

The luxurious life of bells ringing and cauldrons of food is not precious;
I would rather be forever intoxicated and never sober again.

Since ancient times, sages and the wise have been neglected and lonely,
only those who are good at drinking can leave a fine name.

King Cao of Chen once held a grand banquet in the Pingle View,
a picul of wine worth a thousand gold still laughed heartily.

Do not worry, host, about the money spent,
just bring out the wine and let me drink with my friends.

Bring the precious five-flower horse, take out the fox fur coat worth a thousand gold,
quickly tell the servant to exchange it for fine wine,
let us raise our cups together to melt this eternal sorrow.
