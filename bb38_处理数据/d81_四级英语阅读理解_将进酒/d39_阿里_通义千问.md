Have you not seen the waters of the Yellow River pour down from heaven,
surging forward with unstoppable force toward the East Sea never to return?

Have you not seen, in the high hall before a bright mirror, mourning the arrival of white hair,
where only in the morning were locks still black as ink, yet by night they have turned as white as snow?

When fortune smiles upon one's life, one should revel in joy without reserve,
never allowing a golden cup to sit idle before the luminous moon.

Born with the timber of a great pillar, I am destined for grand purpose;
even should a thousand taels of gold be spent, they shall be regained.

Let us feast on lamb and oxen, indulging without restraint, deeming not three hundred cups excessive in a single bout!
Ah, Master Qian and Sir Danqiu, drink up, let not your cups rest!

I will sing you a song of triumph; lend me your ears and listen keenly.


The opulence of bell-ringing, tripod-feasting splendor holds no true value;
I would forever be steeped in intoxication, never to regain sobriety.

Since ancient times, sages and virtuous men have been left desolate and lonely,
while only those skilled at drinking have secured lasting fame.

Prince Chen (Cao Zhi) of the Wei Dynasty once held a grand banquet at Pingguan Pavilion,
where a single dou of wine was worth a thousand coins, yet he drank with abandon.

Host, do not fret over offering too little; simply bring out more wine for me to share with my friends.


Fetch the prized five-flowered horses, retrieve the fox-fur robes worth a thousand gold pieces,
bid the attendants exchange them for fine wine, that we may together raise our cups to dissolve this eternal sorrow.
