Section A


4
00:00:12,11 --> 00:00:15,68
Directions: In this section,


5
00:00:15,68 --> 00:00:18,31
you will hear 8 short conversations


6
00:00:18,31 --> 00:00:21,16
and 2 long conversations.


7
00:00:21,16 --> 00:00:23,65
At the end of each conversation,


8
00:00:23,65 --> 00:00:26,34
one or more questions will be asked about


9
00:00:26,34 --> 00:00:27,76
what was said.


10
00:00:27,76 --> 00:00:30,64
Both the conversation and the questions


11
00:00:30,64 --> 00:00:33,31
will be spoken only once.


12
00:00:33,31 --> 00:00:36,71
After each question there will be a pause.


13
00:00:36,71 --> 00:00:38,62
During the pause,


14
00:00:38,62 --> 00:00:40,72
you must read the four choices


15
00:00:40,72 --> 00:00:44,55
marked A), B), C) and D),


16
00:00:44,55 --> 00:00:48,08
and decide which is the best answer.


17
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:50,59
Then mark the corresponding letter


18
00:00:50,59 --> 00:00:52,53
on Answer Sheet 1


19
00:00:52,53 --> 00:00:55,77
with a single line through the centre.


20
00:00:55,77 --> 00:01:01,87
Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.


21
00:01:01,87 --> 00:01:05,57
1. W: I can¡¯t seem to reach the tea


22
00:01:05,57 --> 00:01:07,81
at the back of the cupboard.


23
00:01:07,81 --> 00:01:10,41
M: Oh. Why don¡¯t you use the ladder?


24
00:01:10,41 --> 00:01:13,21
You might strain your shoulder.


25
00:01:13,21 --> 00:01:32,17
Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?


26
00:01:32,17 --> 00:01:36,32
2. W: Since it¡¯s raining so hard,


27
00:01:36,32 --> 00:01:39,09
let¡¯s go and see the new exhibits.


28
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:41,14
M: That¡¯s a good idea.


29
00:01:41,14 --> 00:01:44,68
Mary Johnson is one of my favorite painters.


30
00:01:44,68 --> 00:02:05,01
Q: Where does the conversation most probably take place?


31
00:02:05,01 --> 00:02:09,24
3. M: I hear the students gave the new teacher


32
00:02:09,24 --> 00:02:11,91
an unfair evaluation.


33
00:02:11,91 --> 00:02:16,33
W: It depends on which students you are talking about.


34
00:02:16,33 --> 00:02:34,09
Q: What does the woman imply?


35
00:02:34,09 --> 00:02:38,55
4. W: It must have taken you a long time


36
00:02:38,55 --> 00:02:41,48
to fix up all these book shelves.


37
00:02:41,48 --> 00:02:42,76
M: It wasn¡¯t too bad.


38
00:02:42,76 --> 00:02:45,76
I got Doris to do some of them.


39
00:02:45,76 --> 00:03:03,37
Q: What does the man mean?


40
00:03:03,37 --> 00:03:07,46
5. W: Rod, I hear you¡¯ll be leaving


41
00:03:07,46 --> 00:03:09,16
at the end of this month.


42
00:03:09,16 --> 00:03:10,35
Is it true?


43
00:03:10,35 --> 00:03:13,57
M: Yeah. I¡¯ve been offered a much better position


44
00:03:13,57 --> 00:03:15,11
with another firm.


45
00:03:15,11 --> 00:03:18,62
I¡¯d be a fool to turn it down.


46
00:03:18,62 --> 00:03:37,25
Q: Why is the man quitting his job?


47
00:03:37,25 --> 00:03:41,62
6. W: I honestly don¡¯t want to continue


48
00:03:41,62 --> 00:03:43,52
the gardening tomorrow, Tony?


49
00:03:43,52 --> 00:03:44,61
M: Neither do I.


50
00:03:44,61 --> 00:03:48,79
But I think we should get it over with this weekend.


51
00:03:48,79 --> 00:04:06,16
Q: What does the man mean?


52
00:04:06,16 --> 00:04:10,63
7. W: You¡¯ve already furnished your apartment?


53
00:04:10,63 --> 00:04:14,48
M: I found some used furniture that was dirt cheap.


54
00:04:14,48 --> 00:04:33,31
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?


55
00:04:33,31 --> 00:04:38,48
8. W: Has the mechanic called about the repairers?


56
00:04:38,48 --> 00:04:42,41
M: Not yet. I¡¯ll let you know when he calls.


57
00:04:42,41 --> 00:05:00,63
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?


58
00:05:00,63 --> 00:05:04,11
Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.


59
00:05:04,11 --> 00:05:06,44
Conversation One


60
00:05:06,44 --> 00:05:09,23
M: Hello£¬ Matt Ellis speaking.


61
00:05:09,23 --> 00:05:12,79
W: Hello, Dr. Ellis. My name¡¯s Pan Johnson.


62
00:05:12,79 --> 00:05:17,17
My roommate, Janet Holmes, wanted me to call you.


63
00:05:17,17 --> 00:05:20,72
M: Janet Holmes? Oh, that¡¯s right.


64
00:05:20,72 --> 00:05:24,17
She¡¯s in my Shakespearean English class.


65
00:05:24,17 --> 00:05:26,67
Has anything happened to her?


66
00:05:26,67 --> 00:05:27,74
W: Nothing.


67
00:05:27,74 --> 00:05:31,71
It¡¯s just that she submitted a job application yesterday


68
00:05:31,71 --> 00:05:35,80
and the company asked her in for an interview today.


69
00:05:35,80 --> 00:05:38,42
She¡¯s afraid she won¡¯t be able to attend your class


70
00:05:38,42 --> 00:05:40,32
this afternoon though.


71
00:05:40,32 --> 00:05:42,61
I¡¯m calling to see whether it would be OK


72
00:05:42,61 --> 00:05:45,11
if I gave you her essay.


73
00:05:45,11 --> 00:05:47,86
Janet said it¡¯s due today.


74
00:05:47,86 --> 00:05:48,78
M: Certainly.


75
00:05:48,78 --> 00:05:50,38
That would be fine.


76
00:05:50,38 --> 00:05:53,84
Uh, you can either drop it off at my class


77
00:05:53,84 --> 00:05:56,41
or bring it to my office.


78
00:05:56,41 --> 00:05:59,27
W: Would it be all right to come by your office


79
00:05:59,27 --> 00:06:01,01
around 4:00?


80
00:06:01,01 --> 00:06:03,32
I¡¯m afraid I can¡¯t come any earlier


81
00:06:03,32 --> 00:06:06,76
because I have three classes this afternoon.


82
00:06:06,76 --> 00:06:09,57
M: Uh, I won¡¯t be here when you come.


83
00:06:09,57 --> 00:06:13,07
I¡¯m supposed to be at a meeting from 3:00 to 6:00,


84
00:06:13,07 --> 00:06:16,01
but how about leaving it with my secretary?


85
00:06:16,01 --> 00:06:18,86
She usually stays until 5:00.


86
00:06:18,86 --> 00:06:23,18
W: Fine. Please tell her I¡¯ll be there at 4:00.


87
00:06:23,18 --> 00:06:25,77
And Dr. Ellis, one more thing,


88
00:06:25,77 --> 00:06:28,55
could you tell me where your office is?


89
00:06:28,55 --> 00:06:31,27
Janet told me where your class is,


90
00:06:31,27 --> 00:06:34,54
but she didn¡¯t give me directions to your office.


91
00:06:34,54 --> 00:06:38,89
M: Well, I¡¯m in Room 302 of the Gregory Building.


92
00:06:38,89 --> 00:06:42,32
I¡¯ll tell my secretary to put the paper in my mail box,


93
00:06:42,32 --> 00:06:44,18
and I¡¯ll get it when I return.


94
00:06:44,18 --> 00:06:47,15
W: I sure appreciate it. Goodbye, Dr. Ellis.


95
00:06:47,15 --> 00:06:49,73
M: Goodbye, Ms. Johnson.


96
00:06:49,73 --> 00:06:52,44
Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation


97
00:06:52,44 --> 00:06:55,24
you have just heard.


98
00:06:55,24 --> 00:06:59,75
9. Why couldn¡¯t the woman¡¯s roommate attend


99
00:06:59,75 --> 00:07:18,10
the Shakespearean English class that afternoon?


100
00:07:18,10 --> 00:07:39,50
10. What favor is the woman going to do for her roommate?


101
00:07:39,50 --> 00:07:43,47
11. What does the woman want to know


102
00:07:43,47 --> 00:08:01,65
at the end of the conversation?


103
00:08:01,65 --> 00:08:04,23
Conversation Two


104
00:08:04,23 --> 00:08:06,11
W: How are things going, Roald?


105
00:08:06,11 --> 00:08:07,80
M: Not bad, Jane.


106
00:08:07,80 --> 00:08:12,25
I¡¯m involved in several projects and it¡¯s a long working day.


107
00:08:12,25 --> 00:08:15,77
But I¡¯m used to that, so it doesn¡¯t bother me too much.


108
00:08:15,77 --> 00:08:21,20
W: I heard you have moved to a new house in the suburb.


109
00:08:21,20 --> 00:08:24,20
How do you like commuting to London every day?


110
00:08:24,20 --> 00:08:26,53
Don¡¯t you find it a strain?


111
00:08:26,53 --> 00:08:28,56
M: It was terrible at first,


112
00:08:28,56 --> 00:08:33,54
especially getting up before dawn to catch that 6:30 train.


113
00:08:33,54 --> 00:08:36,82
But it¡¯s bearable now that I¡¯ m used to it.


114
00:08:36,82 --> 00:08:40,10
W: Don¡¯t you think it¡¯s an awful waste of time?


115
00:08:40,10 --> 00:08:42,83
I couldn¡¯t bear to spend three hours


116
00:08:42,83 --> 00:08:44,99
sitting in a train every day.


117
00:08:44,99 --> 00:08:47,00
M: I used to feel the same as you.


118
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:49,97
But now I quite enjoy it.


119
00:08:49,97 --> 00:08:52,01
W: How do you pass the time?


120
00:08:52,01 --> 00:08:55,48
Do you bring some work with you to do on the train?


121
00:08:55,48 --> 00:08:57,71
M: Ah, that¡¯s a good question.


122
00:08:57,71 --> 00:08:58,80
In the morning,


123
00:08:58,80 --> 00:09:01,59
I just sit in comfort and read the papers


124
00:09:01,59 --> 00:09:03,79
to catch up with the news.


125
00:09:03,79 --> 00:09:05,59
On the way home at night,


126
00:09:05,59 --> 00:09:09,38
I relax with a good book or chat with friends


127
00:09:09,38 --> 00:09:12,07
or even have a game of bridge.


128
00:09:12,07 --> 00:09:15,40
W: I suppose you know lots of people on the train now.


129
00:09:15,40 --> 00:09:18,59
M: Yes, I bumped into someone I know


130
00:09:18,59 --> 00:09:20,53
on the platform every day.


131
00:09:20,53 --> 00:09:23,59
Last week I came across a couple of old school friends


132
00:09:23,59 --> 00:09:26,62
and we spent the entire journey in the bar.


133
00:09:26,62 --> 00:09:28,66
W: It sounds like a good club.


134
00:09:28,66 --> 00:09:31,54
You never know. I may join it too.


135
00:09:31,54 --> 00:09:35,86
Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation


136
00:09:35,86 --> 00:09:38,02
you have just heard.


137
00:09:38,02 --> 00:09:57,86
12. What does the man say about his job?


138
00:09:57,86 --> 00:10:18,60
13. Which train does the man take to work every day?


139
00:10:18,60 --> 00:10:23,51
14. How does the man feel about commuting to work


140
00:10:23,51 --> 00:10:40,52
every day now?


141
00:10:40,52 --> 00:11:01,26
15. How does the man spend his time on the morning train?


142
00:11:01,26 --> 00:11:02,76
Section B


143
00:11:02,76 --> 00:11:05,30
Directions: In this section,


144
00:11:05,30 --> 00:11:08,56
you will hear 3 short passages.


145
00:11:08,56 --> 00:11:10,79
At the end of each passage,


146
00:11:10,79 --> 00:11:13,05
you will hear some questions.


147
00:11:13,05 --> 00:11:15,17
Both the passage and the questions


148
00:11:15,17 --> 00:11:18,04
will be spoken only once.


149
00:11:18,04 --> 00:11:20,20
After you hear a question,


150
00:11:20,20 --> 00:11:23,55
you must choose the best answer from the four choices


151
00:11:23,55 --> 00:11:27,28
marked A), B), C) and D).


152
00:11:27,28 --> 00:11:31,42
Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1


153
00:11:31,42 --> 00:11:34,70
with a single line through the centre.


154
00:11:34,70 --> 00:11:36,66
Passage One


155
00:11:36,66 --> 00:11:41,21
Most American college students need to be efficient readers.


156
00:11:41,21 --> 00:11:42,85
This is necessary


157
00:11:42,85 --> 00:11:44,72
because full-time students probably


158
00:11:44,72 --> 00:11:48,94
have to read several hundred pages every week.


159
00:11:48,94 --> 00:11:53,53
They don¡¯t have time to read a chapter three or four times.


160
00:11:53,53 --> 00:11:56,43
They need to extract as much information as possible


161
00:11:56,43 --> 00:11:59,82
from the first or second reading.


162
00:11:59,82 --> 00:12:03,50
An extraordinarily important study skill


163
00:12:03,50 --> 00:12:05,92
is knowing how to mark a book.


164
00:12:05,92 --> 00:12:09,90
Students mark the main ideas and important details


165
00:12:09,90 --> 00:12:11,77
with a pen or pencil,


166
00:12:11,77 --> 00:12:13,92
yellow or blue or orange.


167
00:12:13,92 --> 00:12:18,22
Some students mark new vocabulary in a different color.


168
00:12:18,22 --> 00:12:23,48
Most students write questions or short notes in the margins.


169
00:12:23,48 --> 00:12:27,02
Marking a book is a useful skill,


170
00:12:27,02 --> 00:12:29,88
but it¡¯s important to do it right.


171
00:12:29,88 --> 00:12:34,01
First, read a chapter with one pen in your hand


172
00:12:34,01 --> 00:12:37,70
and others next to you on the desk.


173
00:12:37,70 --> 00:12:42,56
Second, read a whole paragraph before you mark anything.


174
00:12:42,56 --> 00:12:45,12
Don¡¯t mark too much.


175
00:12:45,12 --> 00:12:49,09
Usually you will mark about 10% of a passage.


176
00:12:49,09 --> 00:12:54,47
Third, decide on your own system for marking.


177
00:12:54,47 --> 00:12:55,70
For example,


178
00:12:55,70 --> 00:12:58,66
maybe you will mark main ideas in yellow,


179
00:12:58,66 --> 00:13:03,51
important details in blue and new words in orange.


180
00:13:03,51 --> 00:13:06,49
Maybe you will put question marks in the margin


181
00:13:06,49 --> 00:13:09,40
when you don¡¯t understand something.


182
00:13:09,40 --> 00:13:12,01
When your chapter is a rainbow of markings,


183
00:13:12,01 --> 00:13:16,72
you don¡¯t have to read all of it again before an exam.


184
00:13:16,72 --> 00:13:20,23
Instead, you just need to review your marks


185
00:13:20,23 --> 00:13:23,28
and you can save a lot of time.


186
00:13:23,28 --> 00:13:26,73
Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage


187
00:13:26,73 --> 00:13:29,10
you have just heard.


188
00:13:29,10 --> 00:13:33,89
16. What should American college students do


189
00:13:33,89 --> 00:13:52,24
to cope with their heavy reading assignments?


190
00:13:52,24 --> 00:13:57,01
17. What suggestion does the speaker give about


191
00:13:57,01 --> 00:14:13,83
marking a textbook?


192
00:14:13,83 --> 00:14:19,00
18. How should students prepare for an exam


193
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:36,47
according to the speaker?


194
00:14:36,47 --> 00:14:38,49
Passage Two


195
00:14:38,49 --> 00:14:43,31
The thought of having no sleep for 24 hours or more


196
00:14:43,31 --> 00:14:46,56
isn¡¯t a pleasant one for most people.


197
00:14:46,56 --> 00:14:51,03
The amount of sleep that each person needs varies.


198
00:14:51,03 --> 00:14:56,09
In general, each of us needs about 8 hours of sleep each day


199
00:14:56,09 --> 00:14:58,57
to keep us healthy and happy.


200
00:14:58,57 --> 00:15:04,58
Some people, however, can get by with just a few hours of sleep at night.


201
00:15:04,58 --> 00:15:08,39
It doesn¡¯t matter when or how much a person sleeps.


202
00:15:08,39 --> 00:15:12,28
But everyone needs some rest to stay alive.


203
00:15:12,28 --> 00:15:17,09
Few doctors would have thought that there might be an exception to this.


204
00:15:17,09 --> 00:15:18,62
Sleep is, after all,


205
00:15:18,62 --> 00:15:21,37
a very basic need.


206
00:15:21,37 --> 00:15:26,06
But a man named Al Herpin turned out to be a rare exception,


207
00:15:26,06 --> 00:15:29,05
for supposedly he never slept!


208
00:15:29,05 --> 00:15:34,93
Al Herpin was 90 years old when doctors came to his home in New Jersey.


209
00:15:34,93 --> 00:15:38,37
They hoped to challenge the claim that he never slept.


210
00:15:38,37 --> 00:15:40,30
But they were surprised.


211
00:15:40,30 --> 00:15:42,88
Though they watched him every hour of the day,


212
00:15:42,88 --> 00:15:47,62
they never saw Herpin sleeping. He did not even own a bed.


213
00:15:47,62 --> 00:15:49,35
He never needed one.


214
00:15:49,35 --> 00:15:54,39
The closest that Herpin came to resting was to sit in a rocking chair


215
00:15:54,39 --> 00:15:57,91
and read a half dozen newspapers.


216
00:15:57,91 --> 00:16:02,90
His doctors were puzzled by the strange case of permanent sleeplessness.


217
00:16:02,90 --> 00:16:06,24
Herpin offered the only clue to his condition.


218
00:16:06,24 --> 00:16:08,93
He remembered some talk about his mother


219
00:16:08,93 --> 00:16:13,33
having been injured several days before he had been born.


220
00:16:13,33 --> 00:16:19,96
Herpin died at the age of 94, never, it seems, having slept at all.


221
00:16:19,96 --> 00:16:25,76
Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.


222
00:16:25,76 --> 00:16:46,35
19. What is taken for granted by most people?


223
00:16:46,35 --> 00:17:06,89
20. What do doctors think of Al Herpin¡¯s case?


224
00:17:06,89 --> 00:17:28,27
21. What could have accounted for Al Herpin¡¯s sleeplessness?


225
00:17:28,27 --> 00:17:30,55
Passage Three


226
00:17:30,55 --> 00:17:34,61
Hetty Green was a very spoiled, only child.


227
00:17:34,61 --> 00:17:40,00
She was born in Massachusetts USA in 1835.


228
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:43,47
Her father was a millionaire businessman.


229
00:17:43,47 --> 00:17:45,65
Her mother was often ill,


230
00:17:45,65 --> 00:17:47,36
and so from the age of two


231
00:17:47,36 --> 00:17:50,17
her father took her with him to work


232
00:17:50,17 --> 00:17:53,60
and taught her about stocks and shares.


233
00:17:53,60 --> 00:17:55,26
At the age of six


234
00:17:55,26 --> 00:17:58,62
she started reading the daily financial newspapers


235
00:17:58,62 --> 00:18:03,35
and opened her own bank account. Her father died


236
00:18:03,35 --> 00:18:09,62
when she was 21 and she inherited 7.5 million dollars.


237
00:18:09,62 --> 00:18:13,68
She went to New York and invested on Wall Street.


238
00:18:13,68 --> 00:18:16,04
Hetty saved every penny,


239
00:18:16,04 --> 00:18:20,11
eating in the cheapest restaurants for 15 cents.


240
00:18:20,11 --> 00:18:25,18
She became one of the richest and most hated women in the world.


241
00:18:25,18 --> 00:18:29,92
At 33 she married Edward Green, a multi-millionaire,


242
00:18:29,92 --> 00:18:32,03
and had two children,


243
00:18:32,03 --> 00:18:37,63
Ned and Sylvia. Hetty¡¯s meanness was well-known.


244
00:18:37,63 --> 00:18:41,57
She always argued about prices in shops.


245
00:18:41,57 --> 00:18:45,73
She walked to the local grocery store to buy broken biscuits


246
00:18:45,73 --> 00:18:47,30
which were much cheaper,


247
00:18:47,30 --> 00:18:51,20
and to get a free bone for her much loved dog.


248
00:18:51,20 --> 00:18:57,07
Once she lost a two-cent stamp and spent the night looking for it.


249
00:18:57,07 --> 00:18:58,80
She never bought clothes


250
00:18:58,80 --> 00:19:03,57
and always wore the same long, ragged black skirt.


251
00:19:03,57 --> 00:19:04,74
Worst of all,


252
00:19:04,74 --> 00:19:08,02
when her son, Ned, fell and injured his knee,


253
00:19:08,02 --> 00:19:10,61
she refused to pay for a doctor


254
00:19:10,61 --> 00:19:14,18
and spent hours looking for free medical help.


255
00:19:14,18 --> 00:19:17,55
In the end Ned lost his leg.


256
00:19:17,55 --> 00:19:20,90
When she died in 1916£¬


257
00:19:20,90 --> 00:19:24,88
she left her children 100 million dollars.


258
00:19:24,88 --> 00:19:28,88
Her daughter built a hospital with her money.


259
00:19:28,88 --> 00:19:32,90
Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage


260
00:19:32,90 --> 00:19:35,60
you have just heard.


261
00:19:35,60 --> 00:19:56,34
22. What do we learn about Hetty Green as a child?


262
00:19:56,34 --> 00:20:17,44
23. How did Hetty Green become rich overnight?


263
00:20:17,44 --> 00:20:37,92
24. Why was Hetty Green much hated?


264
00:20:37,92 --> 00:20:58,59
25. What do we learn about Hetty¡¯s daughter?


265
00:20:58,59 --> 00:21:00,29
Section C


266
00:21:00,29 --> 00:21:06,61
Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times.


267
00:21:06,61 --> 00:21:09,29
When the passage is read for the first time,


268
00:21:09,29 --> 00:21:13,44
you should listen carefully for its general idea.


269
00:21:13,44 --> 00:21:16,07
When the passage is read for the second time,


270
00:21:16,07 --> 00:21:19,81
you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words


271
00:21:19,81 --> 00:21:21,70
you have just heard.


272
00:21:21,70 --> 00:21:25,75
Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,


273
00:21:25,75 --> 00:21:29,18
you should check what you have written.


274
00:21:29,18 --> 00:21:33,24
Now listen to the passage.


275
00:21:33,24 --> 00:21:35,60
Among the kinds of social gestures


276
00:21:35,60 --> 00:21:39,58
most significant for second-language teachers are those


277
00:21:39,58 --> 00:21:43,25
which are identical in form but different in meaning


278
00:21:43,25 --> 00:21:45,26
in the two cultures.


279
00:21:45,26 --> 00:21:46,57
For example,


280
00:21:46,57 --> 00:21:49,74
a Colombian who wants someone to approach him


281
00:21:49,74 --> 00:21:52,59
often signals with a hand movement


282
00:21:52,59 --> 00:21:55,63
in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped,


283
00:21:55,63 --> 00:22:00,12
point downward as they move rapidly back and forth.


284
00:22:00,12 --> 00:22:03,76
Speakers of English have a similar gesture


285
00:22:03,76 --> 00:22:06,36
though the hand may not be cupped


286
00:22:06,36 --> 00:22:09,04
and the fingers may be held more loosely,


287
00:22:09,04 --> 00:22:14,14
but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away,


288
00:22:14,14 --> 00:22:17,50
quite the opposite of the Colombian gesture.


289
00:22:17,50 --> 00:22:20,02
Again, in Colombia,


290
00:22:20,02 --> 00:22:23,23
a speaker of English would have to know that


291
00:22:23,23 --> 00:22:25,10
when he indicates height


292
00:22:25,10 --> 00:22:29,03
he must choose between different gestures depending on


293
00:22:29,03 --> 00:22:33,92
whether he is referring to a human being or an animal.


294
00:22:33,92 --> 00:22:37,79
If he keeps the palm of the hand parallel to the floor,


295
00:22:37,79 --> 00:22:39,42
as he would in his own culture


296
00:22:39,42 --> 00:22:42,74
when making known the height of a child, for example,


297
00:22:42,74 --> 00:22:46,43
he will very likely be greeted by laughter;


298
00:22:46,43 --> 00:22:52,40
in Colombia this gesture is reserved for the description of animals.


299
00:22:52,40 --> 00:22:54,72
In order to describe human beings


300
00:22:54,72 --> 00:22:59,68
he should keep the palm of his hand at a right angle to the floor.


301
00:22:59,68 --> 00:23:04,27
Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create


302
00:23:04,27 --> 00:23:08,43
not only humorous but also embarrassing moments.


303
00:23:08,43 --> 00:23:10,33
In both of the examples above,


304
00:23:10,33 --> 00:23:15,73
speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically,


305
00:23:15,73 --> 00:23:19,03
but its meaning differs sharply.


306
00:23:19,03 --> 00:23:22,93
Now the passage will be read again.


307
00:23:22,93 --> 00:23:25,45
Among the kinds of social gestures


308
00:23:25,45 --> 00:23:29,36
most significant for second-language teachers are those


309
00:23:29,36 --> 00:23:32,53
which are identical in form but different in meaning


310
00:23:32,53 --> 00:23:34,34
in the two cultures.


311
00:23:34,34 --> 00:23:35,80
For example,


312
00:23:35,80 --> 00:23:38,75
a Colombian who wants someone to approach him


313
00:23:38,75 --> 00:23:41,21
often signals with a hand movement


314
00:23:41,21 --> 00:23:44,44
in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped,


315
00:23:44,44 --> 00:23:49,25
point downward as they move rapidly back and forth.


316
00:23:49,25 --> 00:23:52,56
Speakers of English have a similar gesture


317
00:23:52,56 --> 00:23:55,24
though the hand may not be cupped


318
00:23:55,24 --> 00:23:58,26
and the fingers may be held more loosely,


319
00:23:58,26 --> 00:24:02,01
but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away,


320
00:24:02,01 --> 00:24:05,40
quite the opposite of the Colombian gesture.


321
00:24:05,40 --> 00:24:07,20
Again, in Colombia,


322
00:24:07,20 --> 00:24:10,94
a speaker of English would have to know that


323
00:24:10,94 --> 00:24:12,49
when he indicates height


324
00:24:12,49 --> 00:24:16,07
he must choose between different gestures depending on


325
00:24:16,07 --> 00:24:19,48
whether he is referring to a human being or an animal.


326
00:24:19,48 --> 00:24:24,16
If he keeps the palm of the hand parallel to the floor,


327
00:24:24,16 --> 00:24:25,97
as he would in his own culture


328
00:24:25,97 --> 00:24:28,60
when making known the height of a child, for example,


329
00:24:28,60 --> 00:24:32,35
he will very likely be greeted by laughter;


330
00:24:32,35 --> 00:24:37,18
in Colombia this gesture is reserved for the description of animals.


331
00:24:37,18 --> 00:24:39,65
In order to describe human beings


332
00:24:39,65 --> 00:24:44,59
he should keep the palm of his hand at a right angle to the floor.


333
00:24:44,59 --> 00:24:49,22
Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create


334
00:24:49,22 --> 00:24:53,66
not only humorous but also embarrassing moments.


335
00:24:53,66 --> 00:24:56,10
In both of the examples above,


336
00:24:56,10 --> 00:25:00,87
speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically,


337
00:25:00,87 --> 00:25:04,61
but its meaning differs sharply.


338
00:25:04,61 --> 00:25:08,77
Now the passage will be read for the third time.


339
00:25:08,77 --> 00:25:11,12
Among the kinds of social gestures


340
00:25:11,12 --> 00:25:15,16
most significant for second-language teachers are those


341
00:25:15,16 --> 00:25:18,97
which are identical in form but different in meaning


342
00:25:18,97 --> 00:25:21,09
in the two cultures.


343
00:25:21,09 --> 00:25:22,35
For example,


344
00:25:22,35 --> 00:25:25,24
a Colombian who wants someone to approach him


345
00:25:25,24 --> 00:25:28,05
often signals with a hand movement


346
00:25:28,05 --> 00:25:31,31
in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped,


347
00:25:31,31 --> 00:25:35,20
point downward as they move rapidly back and forth.


348
00:25:35,20 --> 00:25:39,34
Speakers of English have a similar gesture


349
00:25:39,34 --> 00:25:41,91
though the hand may not be cupped


350
00:25:41,91 --> 00:25:44,85
and the fingers may be held more loosely,


351
00:25:44,85 --> 00:25:49,33
but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away,


352
00:25:49,33 --> 00:25:53,12
quite the opposite of the Colombian gesture.


353
00:25:53,12 --> 00:25:55,62
Again, in Colombia,


354
00:25:55,62 --> 00:25:58,88
a speaker of English would have to know that


355
00:25:58,88 --> 00:26:00,57
when he indicates height


356
00:26:00,57 --> 00:26:04,60
he must choose between different gestures depending on


357
00:26:04,60 --> 00:26:09,34
whether he is referring to a human being or an animal.


358
00:26:09,34 --> 00:26:13,18
If he keeps the palm of the hand parallel to the floor,


359
00:26:13,18 --> 00:26:15,16
as he would in his own culture


360
00:26:15,16 --> 00:26:18,19
when making known the height of a child, for example,


361
00:26:18,19 --> 00:26:22,02
he will very likely be greeted by laughter;


362
00:26:22,02 --> 00:26:27,89
in Colombia this gesture is reserved for the description of animals.


363
00:26:27,89 --> 00:26:30,32
In order to describe human beings


364
00:26:30,32 --> 00:26:35,39
he should keep the palm of his hand at a right angle to the floor.


365
00:26:35,39 --> 00:26:39,81
Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create


366
00:26:39,81 --> 00:26:43,99
not only humorous but also embarrassing moments.


367
00:26:43,99 --> 00:26:46,27
In both of the examples above,


368
00:26:46,27 --> 00:26:51,22
speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically,


369
00:26:51,22 --> 00:26:54,29
